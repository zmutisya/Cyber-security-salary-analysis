This project is focused on cybersecurity salary analysis. The dataset provides valuable insights in compensation within the cybersecurity industry. It captures various factors such as work experience, employment type, job titles, salary in USD, employee residence, remote work ratio, company location and company size. Analyzing this data will help to understand salary distribution across different experience levels, identify the most lucrative role, compare compensation between different employment types etc.
